# asgn3
asgn3 includes  shell, heap, quick, and batcher sort implementations with a user get opt with array size, elements to print, and random seed commands.

# building
to build all components for asgn3, run "make all"\
to clean files for asgn3, run "make clean"\
to format files for asgn3, run "make format"

# running
to run sorting.c, run, "./sorting" combined with the available options:

ex "./sorting -a" to run all sorts

-a: enables all sorts\
-h: enables heap sort\
-b: enables batcher sort\
-s: enables shell sort\
-q: enables quick sort\
-r: enables set random seed\
-n: set array size\
-p: print number of elements in array\
-H: print program usage
